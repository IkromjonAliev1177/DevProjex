# DevProjex 📁🌳

**Visual project context builder for humans and AI**

DevProjex is a cross-platform desktop application for **quickly exploring folder/project structures**, selecting what matters, and preparing **clean, controlled context in ASCII or JSON** (tree, file contents, or both) for clipboard and file export.

It’s designed for real projects where CLI output is noisy, IDE tools are unavailable or limited, and you need **clarity, speed, and control**.

> 🔒 Read-only by design — DevProjex never modifies your files.

* **Export to file** from menu (tree / content / tree + content)
* **Search & name filtering** for large projects
* **Smart Ignore + .gitignore support** (scope-aware behavior for mixed workspaces)
* **Extensionless files handling** via dedicated ignore option
* **Git integration** (clone by URL, switch branches, get updates in cached copies)
* **Status bar with live metrics** (tree/content lines, chars, ~tokens)
* **Progress bar + operation cancellation** with safe fallback behavior
* **Modern appearance system**

  * Light / Dark
  * Transparency & blur where supported
  * Presets stored locally
  * Island-based layout and smooth UI animations
* **Animated toasts** for user feedback

## Typical use cases 🎯

* Share project structure in code reviews or chats
* Prepare **clean input for AI assistants** (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
* Extract only relevant modules from large codebases
* Teach or explain project architecture
* Inspect large folders without CLI scripts

DevProjex is not tied to a specific language or IDE.

## What DevProjex does (short & honest)

### ✅ Does

* Builds a visual tree of any folder or project
* Lets you select files/folders via checkboxes
* Supports drag & drop opening (folder or file path)
* Copies:

  * tree (selection-aware, falls back to full)
  * content (selection-aware, falls back to all files)
  * tree + content (selection-aware, falls back to full)
* Exports:

  * tree (`.txt` in ASCII mode, `.json`/`.txt` in JSON mode)
  * content (`.txt`)
  * tree + content (`.txt`, with selected tree format)
* Shows preview output before copy/export
* Shows live output metrics and operation progress in status bar
* Restores previously applied parameters for each local project folder
* Supports smart ignore rules (VCS, IDEs, build outputs)
* Works well on large, layered projects

### ❌ Does not

* Edit, rename, move, or delete files
* Run code or modify your repositories (no commits/merges)
* Export binary file contents
